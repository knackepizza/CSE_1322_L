Faith, if you can believe it, falls something
Like something else falls, like fill in the blanks,
Like it isn’t already loaded, what we’ve all
Thought at one time or another time, while

Sitting in a deck chair, dreaming in a pup
Tent, who really wants to see camouflage
As camouflage and how could we since it
Would cease to be, we would cease to be
