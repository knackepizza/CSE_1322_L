Faith, if you can believe it, falls something
Lk smthng ls flls, lk fll n th blnks,
Like it isn’t already loaded, what we’ve all
Thought at one time or another time, while

Sitting in a deck chair, dreaming in a pup
Tnt, wh rlly wnts t s cmflg
s cmflg nd hw cld w snc t
Would cease to be, we would cease to be
